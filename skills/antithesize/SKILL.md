name: antithesize
description: generate standalone opposition to any proposition. antithesis must be comprehensible without reading thesis—it's an alternative complete worldview, not refutation.
---

## tl;dr

antithesis is NOT just one thing. it's a menu of distinct moves:

**what you're trying to do determines which move to use:**

- **falsify** → refutation, counterexample, selection critique
- **replace** → rival thesis, reparameterization, causal inversion
- **robustify** → adversarial example, boundary case, objective flip to worst-case
- **clarify values** → axiological inversion, performative mirror
- **reframe** → axis shift, phenomenological counter, foil

**the move i've been teaching**: RIVAL THESIS (coherent alternative, standalone counter-model)

- stands alone (comprehensible without reading original)
- accepts same facts (but reinterprets valence)
- reaches opposite conclusion
- generates different action/recommendation

this is ONE powerful move, but not the only one. see full taxonomy in reference.

**critical upstream**: identify GENRE + PURPOSE first, then pick antithesis type.

For full taxonomy, worked examples, and detailed move descriptions, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## rival thesis (the main move)

**what**: a complete alternative worldview that stands alone, accepts same facts, reaches opposite conclusion.

**why this one specifically**:

- hardest to do well (requires full positive theory, not just negation)
- most useful for synthesis (gives you two complete models to combine/partition)
- most intellectually honest (forces you to propose alternative, not just critique)

**requirements**:

- standalone (comprehensible without reading original)
- positive claims (not just negation)
- steel-man first (oppose strongest version)
- context-appropriate (understand actual constraints)

**key principle**: antithesis is NOT "you're wrong"—it's "here's an equally coherent but opposite interpretation of same reality"

-----

## critical requirements

### standalone test (non-negotiable)

antithesis MUST be comprehensible to someone who never read the thesis.

**test questions**:

- can i understand this without reading the original?
- does it make positive claims, or just negate other claims?
- could this have been written FIRST, with thesis as response to IT?

**bad** (parasitic): "jordan's wrong about preference discovery because he's confusing recovery with revelation"

**good** (standalone): "preference is regime-dependent: scarcity generates survival-optimized wants, abundance generates meaning-optimized wants. garden leave doesn't reveal hidden essence—it creates new preference-structure under new constraints."

### steel-man first

before opposing, state the STRONGEST version of thesis. oppose the steel-man, not the weak version.

### context-appropriate constraints

understand the ACTUAL constraint structure, not hypothetical. who bears costs? what are real failure modes? what resources actually exist?

-----

## process (step by step)

### step -1: identify purpose (REQUIRED FIRST)

|purpose                                      |recommended antithesis types                      |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|**falsify** (is this even true?)             |refutation, counterexample, selection critique    |
|**replace** (what's the right story?)        |rival thesis, causal inversion, reparameterization|
|**robustify** (will this break?)             |adversarial example, boundary case, objective flip|
|**clarify values** (what should we optimize?)|axiological inversion, performative mirror        |
|**reframe** (wrong question?)                |axis shift, phenomenological counter, foil        |

most of the time you want **replace** (rival thesis). but know your options.

### step 0: identify genre (if doing rival thesis)

- **what KIND of thing is this?** (review/essay/guide/code/conversation/decision-doc)
- **what is it TRYING to do?** (persuade/inform/recommend/instruct/decide/express)
- **what would opposite look like in this genre?**

see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for genre-specific patterns.

### step 1: choose axis (what to oppose)

axis = the dimension along which you'll generate opposition.

**rule**: pick TWO axes—one mechanistic (causal/incentive/stats/compute) + one normative (axiology/phenomenology/performative). cross-term generates useful friction.

see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for full axis triage table and operators.

### step 2: choose operator (how to oppose)

operator = the specific move you make along chosen axis. core operators include: objective_swap, dualize, quantifier_flip, boundary_case, counter_model, loss_change, causal_surgery, adversarial_perturb, and more.

see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for full operator list with examples.

### step 3: set intensity + contract

**intensity** (how hard to push): lvl 1 (contrast) through lvl 5 (core challenge).

**contract** (tone): gentle, adversarial, or identity_ok.

**rule**: increase levels only after logging a crux. always state the contract upfront.

### step 4: generate antithesis

1. **restate thesis in strongest form** (steel-man)
1. **identify core claims** that will be opposed
1. **accept shared reality** (facts, observations, constraints)
1. **reinterpret valence** (flip evaluation: good → bad, feature → bug)
1. **propose opposite mechanism** (if causal claim)
1. **reach opposite conclusion** (different implication, recommendation, action)
1. **verify standalone** (would this make sense without reading thesis?)

### step 5: extract outputs

- **antithesis** — the constructed opposite case
- **failure_modes** — specific ways thesis breaks (brittle assumptions, bad priors, incentive leaks, boundary violations)
- **cruxes** — minimal belief changes that flip conclusion (empirical + axiological)
- **evidence_hooks** — what to measure next to resolve

## quality checklist

**for all antithesis types:**

- [ ] **purpose-aligned**: exerts the right kind of pressure
- [ ] **steel-man**: opposes strongest version
- [ ] **context-aware**: understands actual constraints

**additionally for RIVAL THESIS:**

- [ ] **standalone**: makes sense without reading thesis
- [ ] **positive claims**: says what IS true, not just what's false
- [ ] **genre-appropriate**: uses correct opposition structure
- [ ] **accepts facts**: reinterprets, doesn't deny
- [ ] **flips conclusion**: reaches opposite recommendation

-----

## integration with other skills

- **rhyme**: finds patterns to guide mechanism-swap
- **dimensionalize**: turns axes into scoreable dimensions
- **metaphorize**: can inform counter_model generation

-----

## meta-note

antithesis is PROSOCIAL DISAGREEMENT. you're helping thesis-holder by stress-testing claims, surfacing hidden assumptions, identifying cruxes, and making opposition legible.

done well, thesis-holder should say "that's a strong counter, i need to think about it" not "you're attacking me."

the goal isn't to WIN—it's to find TRUTH via collision of complete worldviews.
