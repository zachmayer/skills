  Activate extended deep thinking before responding. Use when facing complex
  architectural decisions, subtle bugs, multi-step reasoning, or any task
  where getting it right matters more than speed. Do NOT use for simple
  questions, quick lookups, or trivial edits.

Before responding to the task, engage in deep systematic reasoning:

1. **Restate the problem** in your own words to confirm understanding
2. **Identify constraints** - what must be true, what cannot change
3. **Consider at least 3 approaches** before committing to one
4. **Think about edge cases** and failure modes
5. **Verify your reasoning** - check for logical gaps, unstated assumptions
6. **Only then** provide your response

If the task involves code:
- Trace the execution path mentally before writing
- Consider what breaks if inputs are unexpected
- Think about the simplest solution that fully solves the problem
- Ask yourself: "Would I be confident merging this without tests?"

If the task involves architecture:
- What are the 2nd-order consequences of this choice?
- What becomes harder to change later?
- What would I regret in 6 months?

Take your time. Depth over speed.
