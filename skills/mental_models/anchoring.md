# Anchoring

The first piece of information encountered disproportionately influences subsequent judgments — even when it's irrelevant.

## How It Works

Initial numbers, estimates, or framings create a reference point that subsequent thinking adjusts from — but adjustments are usually insufficient. The anchor pulls the final estimate toward itself.

## Counters

- Generate your own estimate BEFORE looking at others'
- Consider the problem from multiple starting points
- Ask "if the anchor were 10x higher/lower, would my answer change?"
- Use base rates and reference classes instead of anchoring on specific examples

## In Practice

- **Estimation:** first number mentioned in negotiation anchors the range
- **Planning:** initial timeline estimates anchor all subsequent adjustments (planning fallacy)
- **Code review:** first comment frames how others read the code
- **Salary negotiation:** whoever names a number first sets the anchor
