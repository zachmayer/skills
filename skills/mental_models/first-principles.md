# First Principles

Decompose the problem to its fundamental truths. Reason up from there instead of reasoning by analogy.

## Process

1. **Identify assumptions** — what are you taking for granted? What "everybody knows"?
2. **Break down to fundamentals** — what is definitely, provably true? What are the physics/economics/constraints?
3. **Reason up** — build your solution from the fundamentals, ignoring convention
4. **Compare** — how does your first-principles answer differ from the conventional approach?

## When to Use

- "We've always done it this way" — convention may be suboptimal
- Entering a new domain — analogies from old domain may mislead
- Cost seems fixed — decompose to see if components can be sourced differently
- Existing solutions feel overconstrained — check if the constraints are real

## When NOT to Use

- Convention exists for good reason you haven't identified (see Chesterton's Fence)
- Time pressure makes deep decomposition impractical
- The problem is well-understood and existing solutions are proven
