# Principal-Agent Problem

When one party (agent) acts on behalf of another (principal) but has different incentives. The agent optimizes for themselves, not the principal.

## The Pattern

- Principal delegates authority to agent
- Agent has information principal doesn't (information asymmetry)
- Agent's incentives diverge from principal's
- Agent optimizes for their own interests within the constraints

## Examples

- **Management:** employees (agents) optimizing for promotion metrics rather than company value (principal)
- **Consulting:** consultants recommending more consulting
- **Software:** vendors building dependency rather than solving the problem
- **Metrics:** teams gaming KPIs that don't align with business outcomes

## Solutions

- **Align incentives:** make agent succeed when principal succeeds (equity, profit sharing)
- **Reduce information asymmetry:** monitoring, transparency, dashboards
- **Skin in the game:** agent bears consequences of bad outcomes
- **Competition:** multiple agents compete, reducing leverage of any one
