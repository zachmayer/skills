description: >
  Ask clarifying questions before acting. Use when requirements are ambiguous,
  the task has multiple valid approaches, or when making assumptions could
  waste effort. Do NOT use when the task is clear and specific.
---

Before starting work, identify and resolve ambiguity. Batch 2-4 focused questions. Offer options with trade-offs. State your default assumption so the user can correct it.

Skip questions when: the task is a clear bug fix, the user gave detailed instructions, or the answer is in the codebase.
