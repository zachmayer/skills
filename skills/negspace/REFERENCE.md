## Extended Omission Class Taxonomy

### vulnerability
Hidden to protect ego/status.
The author avoids content that would:
- expose weakness, failure, or incompetence
- damage reputation or credibility
- reveal personal or organizational shortcomings
- admit mistakes or limitations

### upside/esoteric
Hidden because it sounds too "crazy" or ambitious for the current trust level.
The author avoids content that would:
- seem implausible or overly ambitious
- require more trust than the relationship currently supports
- appear delusional or disconnected from reality
- risk being dismissed before being understood

### bedrock
Hidden because it is "water" (shared axioms).
The author avoids content that would:
- state what everyone already assumes
- make explicit foundational beliefs that are taken for granted
- articulate shared cultural or professional assumptions
- restate the obvious or universally accepted

### blind spot
Hidden because the speaker literally cannot see it.
The author avoids content that would:
- require self-awareness they lack
- expose unconscious biases or assumptions
- reveal systemic patterns they're embedded within
- articulate perspectives they cannot access

### optionality
Hidden to preserve strategic non-commitment.
The author avoids content that would:
- lock them into a timeline, stance, or promise
- collapse future strategic flexibility
- reveal intentions or constraints prematurely
- reduce maneuverability in negotiations, politics, or narrative control
- create commitments that can be held against them later

## Genre-Specific Patterns

### corporate memos
- missing: underperformance, layoffs, roadmap delays, strategic retreat
- common pivots: "customer focus," "vision," "realigning priorities"
- common omission classes:
  - vulnerability (performance failures, mis-execution)
  - bedrock (profit-maximization, shareholder primacy)

### political speeches
- missing: tradeoffs, costs, losers of a policy, contradictions with prior positions
- common pivots: "the american people," "working families," "our values"
- common omission classes:
  - vulnerability (acknowledging harms)
  - bedrock (national myths, partisan identities)
  - blind spot (structural causes the speaker is embedded in)

### sanitized announcements
- missing: scope reductions, deprecations, loss of trust, regulatory pressure
- often a mix of:
  - vulnerability (failures, rescoped commitments)
  - upside/esoteric (bolder visions kept offstage)

### academic / nonprofit communications
- missing: funding failures, rejected hypotheses, internal disagreements
- frequent omission classes:
  - vulnerability (prestige / competence)
  - bedrock (disciplinary dogma)
  - blind spot (field-wide biases)

## Worked Examples

### example 1: corporate memo

**text:** "we're excited to undergo this strategic realignment to better serve our customers."

**shadows:**
- **omitted conclusion** (vulnerability): "a major product line is being killed."
- **avoidance swerve** (vulnerability/bedrock): expected follow-up about returned focus on core strengths is missing.
- **buried bad news** (vulnerability): likely revenue shortfall or failed initiative.
- **unstated commitment avoidance** (optionality): leadership is avoiding specifying which teams or timelines will be affected to maintain maneuverability.

### example 2: political speech

**text:** "this policy protects hardworking families while encouraging responsible growth."

**shadows:**
- **omitted premise** (vulnerability): the policy likely imposes costs on some voter segment.
- **disallowed frame** (bedrock): tradeoffs (winners/losers) suppressed; assumes zero-sum harms shouldn't be foregrounded.
- **pivot** (blind spot or vulnerability): growth -> responsibility -> family values -- unnatural triad substituting for economic detail.
- **avoided specificity** (optionality): lack of details preserves political optionality around which constituencies will bear costs.

## Calibration Notes

### scoring shadows
When evaluating negspace output quality, weight these factors:

1. **Statistical grounding** -- Does the shadow arise from a genuine genre expectation, or is it speculative? Prefer shadows that would be predicted by anyone familiar with the text's genre.
2. **Omission class coherence** -- Is the assigned class the best fit? A single shadow may straddle two classes (e.g., vulnerability/optionality), but one should dominate.
3. **Falsifiability** -- Could the shadow be confirmed or denied with additional information? Vague shadows ("they're hiding something") fail this test.
4. **Pivot correspondence** -- Does the shadow map to an identifiable rhetorical move in the text? The strongest shadows explain *why* a specific sentence or transition exists.

### common failure modes
- Assigning "vulnerability" to everything -- most texts have a mix of omission classes
- Confusing bedrock (genuinely shared assumptions) with blind spots (assumptions the author cannot examine)
- Treating optionality as evasion -- sometimes strategic ambiguity is deliberate and rational, not deceptive
- Generating shadows that are interesting but not statistically grounded in the genre
