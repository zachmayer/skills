# OODA Loop

Observe → Orient → Decide → Act, then repeat faster than the environment changes. Speed of the loop matters more than perfection of any step.

## The Four Steps

1. **Observe** — gather information from the environment. What's actually happening? (Not what you expected.)
2. **Orient** — make sense of observations using mental models, prior experience, and context. This is the critical step — orientation shapes what you observe and how you decide.
3. **Decide** — select a course of action based on your orientation
4. **Act** — execute the decision, which changes the environment, creating new information to observe

## Key Insights

- **Orient is the schwerpunkt** — it's the most important step. Better orientation leads to better observations, faster decisions, and more effective actions.
- **Speed beats perfection** — cycling through OODA faster than your competition (or faster than the environment changes) creates tempo advantage
- **Implicit guidance and control** — once orientation is strong, many decisions become automatic (experienced practitioners skip the explicit decide step)
- **Disruption = breaking their loop** — present ambiguous information that makes opponents' orientation fail

## Application

- **Incident response:** observe metrics → orient (what's the theory?) → decide (which fix?) → act (deploy) → observe (did it work?)
- **Product iteration:** observe user behavior → orient (why are they doing that?) → decide (what to build) → act (ship) → observe (did it help?)
- **Competition:** cycle faster. Ship → learn → adapt before competitors finish planning.
