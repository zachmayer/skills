# Forcing Function

A constraint that forces confrontation with an issue that would otherwise be deferred indefinitely.

## Types

- **Deadlines:** ship dates force prioritization decisions
- **Budgets:** resource constraints force scope decisions
- **Public commitments:** announced dates force execution
- **Demos:** scheduled demos force integration and polish
- **Migrations:** deprecation deadlines force upgrades
- **Constraints:** "you can only build 3 features" forces ranking

## Application

- When a decision keeps getting deferred, introduce a forcing function
- When quality isn't improving, introduce a review gate
- When priorities are unclear, impose a constraint that requires ranking
- When integration keeps slipping, schedule a demo

## Key Insight

Without forcing functions, decisions defer indefinitely and work expands to fill available time (Parkinson's Law). Forcing functions are how you convert intention into action. The constraint is the feature, not the bug.
