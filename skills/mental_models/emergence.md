# Emergence

Simple rules produce complex behavior. Look for the simple rules underneath complex systems before adding complexity to your solution.

## Application

- **Seek simple rules** — complex system behavior often arises from a few simple interaction rules (flocking, markets, Conway's Game of Life)
- **Bottom-up vs top-down** — emergent properties can't be predicted from individual components alone; they arise from interactions
- **Don't over-engineer** — if simple rules produce the desired behavior, adding complexity usually makes things worse, not better
- **Beware reductionism** — understanding the parts doesn't guarantee understanding the whole when emergence is at play

## When Emergence Matters

- System behavior seems disproportionately complex relative to component simplicity
- "Nobody designed this" — patterns appear without central coordination
- Local optimization produces global dysfunction (or vice versa)
- Small changes produce unexpectedly large systemic effects
