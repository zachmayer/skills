# Dunning-Kruger Effect

Unskilled individuals overestimate their ability; skilled individuals underestimate theirs. The less you know, the less you know about how much you don't know.

## The Pattern

- **Beginner:** high confidence, low competence ("how hard can it be?")
- **Intermediate:** dropping confidence, rising competence ("this is way harder than I thought")
- **Expert:** calibrated confidence, high competence ("I know what I know and what I don't")

## Application

- When confident about something outside your domain, assume you're on the left side of the curve
- When an expert seems uncertain, they may simply be well-calibrated
- The strongest signal of expertise is knowing precisely where your knowledge ends
- Use this as a check: "am I confident because I'm skilled, or because I don't know enough to see the complexity?"
