# Inversion

Instead of asking "how do I succeed?", ask "what would guarantee failure?" and avoid those things.

## Process

1. **State the goal** — what does success look like?
2. **Invert** — what would guarantee failure? List 5-10 ways to certainly fail
3. **Check current state** — are you doing any of these failure-guaranteeing things right now?
4. **Remove obstacles** — eliminate the failure modes you identified
5. **Repeat for sub-goals** — apply inversion at each decision level

## When It Unlocks Insight

- You're stuck on "what should I do?" — flip to "what should I definitely NOT do?"
- Brainstorming solutions feels exhausted — brainstorm disasters instead
- Evaluating a plan — ask "how could this plan fail?" (essentially pre-mortem)
- Debugging — "what conditions would make this bug appear?"

## Variants

- **Failure inversion:** "What would make this project fail?" → avoid those things
- **Subtractive inversion:** "What should I stop doing?" (often more effective than adding)
- **Devil's advocate:** Argue the opposite position to stress-test your reasoning

## Key Principle

Avoiding stupidity is often easier and more reliable than seeking brilliance. The path to success is frequently cleared by systematically removing the obvious ways to fail.
