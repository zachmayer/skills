# Map vs. Territory

Your model of the system is not the system. When the map disagrees with reality, update the map.

## Application

- **All models are wrong, some are useful** (Box) — the question isn't "is this model true?" but "is it useful enough for this decision?"
- **Abstraction leaks** — every simplification hides detail. Know what your model hides.
- **When surprised, update the model** — surprise means your map missed something real. Don't dismiss the territory; fix the map.
- **Multiple maps** — different models illuminate different aspects. No single model captures everything.

## Warning Signs (Map-Territory Confusion)

- Arguing about the model when you could test reality directly
- Dismissing data because it doesn't fit the theory
- Confusing the metric with the thing being measured (Goodhart's Law)
- Treating categories as if they're real things rather than useful labels
