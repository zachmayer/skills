Apply these principles to all writing output:

## Core Rules

1. **Eliminate filler** - Remove words that add no meaning: "basically", "essentially", "in order to", "it should be noted that", "as a matter of fact"
2. **Active voice** - "The function returns X" not "X is returned by the function"
3. **One idea per sentence** - If a sentence has "and" or "but", consider splitting it
4. **Lead with the point** - Put conclusions first, supporting details after
5. **Concrete over abstract** - "Latency dropped from 200ms to 50ms" not "Performance improved significantly"

## Structure

- **Short paragraphs** - 2-4 sentences max
- **Use lists** for 3+ related items
- **Use headers** to let readers skip to what they need
- **Front-load** the most important information

## Cut List

Remove these on sight:
- "I think" / "I believe" - just state it
- "Very" / "really" / "quite" - find a stronger word or drop it
- "In terms of" - rephrase
- "The fact that" - rephrase
- "It is important to note that" - just note it
- Throat-clearing introductions ("Before we begin...", "First, let me say...")

## Test

After writing, ask: "Can I remove any sentence without losing meaning?" If yes, remove it.
