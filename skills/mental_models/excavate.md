# Excavate

Assumption archaeology. Reveals the layered structure of "what must be true" beneath a claim, plan, belief, or principle. Diagnostic — it lights up the skeleton beneath the stance.

## Assumption Types

Tag each assumption with one of five categories:

- **[empirical]** — descriptive world claims, probabilities, causal expectations
- **[normative]** — value judgments, priorities, ethical constraints
- **[structural]** — incentives, institutions, competitive dynamics, coordination structure
- **[psychological]** — assumptions about cognition, motivation, bias, perception
- **[definitional]** — category boundaries, ontology, what terms mean

## Flags

Mark assumptions with:
- **[CRUX]** — flipping this would flip or materially change the claim
- **[HIGH-UNCERTAINTY]** — evidence weak or unknown
- **[HIGH-LEVERAGE]** — clarifying this resolves multiple branches

## Process

### Step 0: Normalize the claim
Ensure the claim is crisp, scoped, and not two claims fused together.

### Step 1: Generate layer-1 assumptions
Ask: "what must be true for this claim to make sense?" Produce 3-7 assumptions, each tagged by type.

### Step 2: Recurse
For each assumption: "what must be true for *that* to make sense?" Produce 1-4 sub-assumptions until hitting a value-axiom, redundancy, or max depth (default 3-4).

### Step 3: Tag flags
Mark assumptions with CRUX, HIGH-UNCERTAINTY, and HIGH-LEVERAGE flags.

### Step 4: Summarize cruxes
Select the 3-7 highest-impact assumptions based on crux × uncertainty × leverage.

### Step 5: Generate probes
Produce concrete questions or tests (empirical, conceptual, institutional) that would update the cruxes.

## Output

- A **layered assumption tree** with tags
- A **crux list** (3-7 load-bearing assumptions)
- **Probe questions** that would most update the stance

## Quality Criteria

- Layers are clean, no duplicated logic
- Tags correctly classify assumption types
- 3-7 assumptions marked as genuine load-bearing points
- Cruxes differ meaningfully in type or leverage
- Surfaces where actual disagreement likely lives
- Distinguishes empirical uncertainty from value conflict
- Each probe targets a crux and is investigable
