# Lindy Effect

The longer a non-perishable thing has survived, the longer its expected remaining lifespan. Future life expectancy is proportional to current age.

## Application

- **Technology choices:** a library maintained for 10 years will likely outlast one released 6 months ago
- **Practices:** programming patterns that have persisted for decades (UNIX philosophy, relational databases) are likely to persist for decades more
- **Books/ideas:** classics remain relevant precisely because they've already survived selection pressure
- **Architecture:** proven patterns (REST, message queues, relational DBs) are lower risk than novel approaches

## Key Insight

Lindy applies to non-perishable things (ideas, technologies, books, institutions) — not perishable things (people, individual products). For non-perishable things, age is a signal of robustness, not obsolescence. Prefer battle-tested over novel when the cost of failure is high.
