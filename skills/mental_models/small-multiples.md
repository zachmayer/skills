# Small Multiples

Show the same data structure repeated with one variable changed. Enables comparison without cognitive load.

## Application

- **Data visualization:** same chart repeated for different time periods, regions, or categories
- **UI design:** show the same screen in different states (empty, loading, populated, error)
- **Code examples:** same algorithm in different languages or with different inputs
- **Test cases:** same structure with different parameters to show edge case behavior
- **Architecture diagrams:** same system at different scales or in different failure modes

## Key Insight

"At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: Compared to what?" (Tufte). Small multiples answer this by making comparison effortless — the eye detects differences automatically when the structure is held constant.
