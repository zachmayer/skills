# Rhyme

## Overview

**Rhyme** is fast structural similarity. It maps a novel input onto known patterns by echo, not deduction. The match may be visual, narrative, functional, or systemic—but it *feels* alike. Not true, not proven—just salient.

Rhyme is upstream of metaphor. It clusters, suggests, frames. Nothing more—but often the first real foothold.

Claude should use this Skill when the user:
- Explicitly asks to "rhyme" something
- Seeks structural parallels or analogies
- Wants to understand an unfamiliar domain through pattern matching
- Needs creative seeding across domains
- Says "what's this like?" or "remind me of..."
- Wants to bootstrap intuition about a new system

## How It Runs (~1-3s cognitive time)

1. **Register A** – Snapshot the input pattern or system
2. **Scan memory** – Passive recall of matching structures
3. **Note shared features** – Form, role, sequence, function
4. **Tag A ↔ B** – Save as active candidate for further analysis

This is pre-analytical pattern matching, not rigorous mapping.

## Rhyme Tropes

Common pattern categories that trigger rhyme:

### Visual Motifs
Spirals, cascades, symmetries, recursions, fractals, waves

### Narrative Arcs
Fall-from-grace, double agent, forbidden loop, hero's journey, tragedy of commons

### Role Dynamics
Scapegoat, saboteur, empty throne, gatekeeper, facilitator, bottleneck

### Formal Patterns
ABBA, edge→core→edge, nested loops, call-and-response

### Process Analogs
Bottlenecked pipeline, open-loop feedback, stochastic search, filtering cascade

### Systemic Frames
- Immune response ↔ infosec
- Political alliance ↔ economic cartel
- Market panic ↔ stampede
- Evolutionary adaptation ↔ A/B testing
- River delta ↔ organizational structure

These act as rhyme scaffolds, even across domains.

## Parameters

| Knob | Range / Values | Effect |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **tightness** | loose → strict | How many shared features needed to register a rhyme |
| **scope** | local → systemic | Whether rhyme is within elements or across processes |
| **breadth** | narrow (1-2 matches) → wide (many candidates) | How many rhymes held in working memory |
| **depth** | surface feature → underlying structure | How abstract the match can be |
| **agenda** | neutral / goal-tuned | Constrain activation by current objective |

**Example tuning:**
- Understanding new domain: loose tightness, wide breadth, systemic scope
- Validation checking: strict tightness, narrow breadth, structural depth
- Creative brainstorming: loose tightness, wide breadth, surface-to-deep range

## Dimensionalization of Rhyme Quality

Score each rhyme candidate on these dimensions (0.0 → 1.0):

### 1. Parallel Density
How many concrete overlaps (not vibes) can you name?
- **0.0** = 1 cute overlap
- **0.5** = ≥2 structural + ≥1 functional
- **1.0** = ≥3 structural + ≥2 functional, independently checkable

### 2. Source Maturity
Is the source domain well-mapped (canon, playbooks, failure literature)?
- **0.0** = Folk wisdom only
- **0.5** = Partial standards, scattered case studies
- **1.0** = Codified heuristics + known traps + metrics

### 3. Operator Expertise (Error-Spotting)
Do you know the source deeply enough to catch leaks?
- **0.0** = Tourist
- **0.5** = Competent user
- **1.0** = Can name edge cases & anti-patterns on demand

### 4. Transfer Leverage
How much working know-how could port if the rhyme holds?
- **0.0** = Decorative frame
- **0.5** = A couple of useful rules
- **1.0** = A compact playbook you can run tomorrow

### 5. Invariants Salience
Are the shared bits causal/transformational, not ornaments?
- **0.0** = Motif only (spirals, masks)
- **0.5** = Roles/flows line up
- **1.0** = Core constraints & transforms align (queues, budgets, feedbacks)

### 6. Exclusion Clarity (Leak-Proofing)
Can you crisply list what doesn't port?
- **0.0** = Hand-wavy "obviously not everything"
- **0.5** = A few do-not-ports
- **1.0** = Explicit exclusion set that would catch most dumb misuses

### 7. Communicability
Can you explain the rhyme in 2-4 bullets to a smart outsider?
- **0.0** = Requires a TED talk
- **0.5** = Intelligible with a diagram
- **1.0** = Lands in 20 seconds, no table needed

### 8. Measurability
Are there observable proxies to test the rhyme quickly?
- **0.0** = Pure vibes
- **0.5** = Qualitative spot-checks
- **1.0** = Leading indicators/metrics exist or are easy to stub

### 9. Time-Scale Alignment
Do the dynamics rhyme on timescale (latency, cadence, decay)?
- **0.0** = Mismatch (days vs microseconds)
- **0.5** = Can be rescaled with care
- **1.0** = Native alignment or trivial rescaling

### 10. Composability
Does the rhyme play nicely with other rhymes/maps?
- **0.0** = Conflicts with your existing frames
- **0.5** = Orthogonal
- **1.0** = Plugs into a larger scaffold (becomes a module)

### 11. Novelty (Anti-Cliché)
Is it fresh enough to cut new affordances, not generic poster talk?
- **0.0** = "Business is war" tier
- **0.5** = Familiar but specific
- **1.0** = Crisp, surprising, and helpful

**Quality threshold:** Strong rhymes score ≥0.6 on parallel density, source maturity, transfer leverage, and invariants salience.

## Output Format

For each rhyme candidate, provide:
```
**[Source Domain] ↔ [Target Domain]**

Shared structures:
- [Structural parallel 1]
- [Structural parallel 2]
- [Functional parallel 1]

Why it rhymes: [One sentence on core similarity]

Quality scores: [Parallel density, Source maturity, Transfer leverage, Invariants salience]

What doesn't port: [2-3 key exclusions]
```

## Example: Protocol Failure Rhyme

**Input:** "An emergent protocol failure where automated systems amplify small errors into cascading problems"

**Rhymes generated:**

1. **Sorcerer's Apprentice (Fantasia) ↔ Protocol Failure**
   - Shared structures:
     - Automation exceeds operator's control
     - Positive feedback with no governor
     - Small action → exponential consequences
     - Helper becomes threat
   - Why it rhymes: Delegated process lacks stop condition
   - Scores: [0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8]
   - Doesn't port: Magic vs code, single actor vs distributed

2. **Cascading Grid Blackout ↔ Protocol Failure**
   - Shared structures:
     - Load redistribution creates new stress
     - Failure propagates through connections
     - Recovery requires external intervention
     - Time-critical detection window
   - Why it rhymes: Network effect amplifies local failure
   - Scores: [0.9, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9]
   - Doesn't port: Physical infrastructure vs digital, slower timescale

3. **Bank Run ↔ Protocol Failure**
   - Shared structures:
     - Rational individual action creates collective harm
     - Self-fulfilling prophecy dynamics
     - Trust threshold collapse
     - Circuit breakers as mitigation
   - Why it rhymes: Coordination failure under stress
   - Scores: [0.8, 0.9, 0.8, 0.9]
   - Doesn't port: Human psychology vs automated logic

**Best candidate:** Cascading grid blackout (highest scores across dimensions, mature source domain with known mitigations)

## Example: Understanding TikTok Scrolling

**Input:** "Why do people spend so much time scrolling TikTok?"

**Rhymes generated:**

1. **Panning for Gold in River ↔ TikTok Scrolling**
   - High-throughput flow, sparse jackpots
   - Hand motions that sift
   - Skill in "where/when to swirl," not producing gold
   - Move-on rules when patch depletes

2. **Patch Foraging (Ecology) ↔ TikTok Scrolling**
   - Probe content patches, decide when to leave
   - Rewards deplete locally
   - Travel cost is time/attention
   - Marginal value theorem applies

3. **QC on Fast Assembly Line ↔ TikTok Scrolling**
   - Rapid yes/no triage
   - Rare exceptions pulled for inspection
   - Fatigue increases misses
   - Throughput over precision

## When to Use

### Understanding Unfamiliar Domains
Bootstrap comprehension via structural echo
- "What does X rhyme with that I already understand?"
- Use mature source domains for maximum transfer

### Creative Seeding
Generate multiple reference-class hits before designing
- "What are 5 systems that share this structure?"
- Wide breadth, loose tightness for divergent thinking

### Intuition Framing
Snap a half-formed hunch to known shape
- "This feels like... but I can't quite name it"
- Surface-level matches often sufficient

### Debugging & Sensemaking
Check for recurring structures in divergent settings
- "Have we seen this failure mode pattern before?"
- Strict tightness, systemic scope for precision

## Common Pitfalls & Patches

| Pitfall | Symptom | Patch |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **False positives** | Superficial resemblances crowding signal | Increase tightness; require functional AND structural overlap |
| **Anchoring** | Early match blocks richer ones | Erase & re-query with shifted lens |
| **Overreach** | Treating rhyme as explanatory | Explicitly flag as pre-model heuristic |
| **Cliché trap** | Generic comparisons ("life is a journey") | Score novelty dimension, require ≥0.6 |
| **Scope mismatch** | Comparing wrong abstraction levels | Clarify whether matching elements or systems |
| **Porting everything** | Assuming all features transfer | Demand explicit exclusion list |

## Downstream Moves

Once rhymes are generated, use these moves for deeper work:

**Dimensionalize:** Filter rhymes for utility, leverage, clarity using the 11 quality dimensions

**Metaphorize:** Build complete structural mapping from best rhyme candidate

## Integration Protocol

### Rhyme → Metaphorize Pipeline
1. Generate 3-5 rhyme candidates
2. Score on quality dimensions
3. Select highest-scoring rhyme (≥0.6 on key dimensions)
4. Use as input for metaphorize move
5. Build complete domain mapping

### Rhyme → Dimensionalize Pipeline
1. Rhyme target domain with mature source
2. Extract source domain's proven dimensions
3. Test which dimensions transfer
4. Adapt dimension definitions for target context

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing rhyme candidates:

- [ ] Generated 3+ distinct rhyme candidates
- [ ] Each rhyme has ≥2 structural parallels
- [ ] Each rhyme has ≥1 functional parallel
- [ ] Scored top candidates on quality dimensions
- [ ] Identified what doesn't port for each rhyme
- [ ] Can explain each rhyme in <30 seconds
- [ ] Selected best candidate scores ≥0.6 on: parallel density, source maturity, transfer leverage, invariants salience
- [ ] Explicitly flagged as pre-analytical pattern match, not proof

## Micro-Example

**Input:** An emergent protocol failure

**Rhyme stack (pre-mapping):**
- Enchanted broom in *Fantasia*
- Cascading blackout
- Sorcerer's apprentice archetype
- Positive feedback loop with no governor
- Runaway chemical reaction
- Flash crash in markets

No formal mapping yet—just a stack of echoes primed for model-building.

**Next move:** Score these candidates, select best, then metaphorize for detailed mapping.

## Advanced Techniques

### Constraint-Based Rhyming
Specify what must rhyme:
- "Rhyme X, but constrain to systems with known failure modes"
- "Rhyme X, focusing on resource allocation patterns"

### Multi-Source Rhyming
Find multiple partial rhymes, synthesize:
- "X rhymes with A for process, B for roles, C for failure modes"
- Composite mapping from multiple sources

### Temporal Rhyming
Match on dynamic patterns across time:
- Growth curves (S-curves, exponential, logarithmic)
- Cycle patterns (boom-bust, seasonal, oscillation)
- Decay patterns (half-life, asymptotic, stepped)

### Anti-Rhyming
Find structural opposites to define boundaries:
- "What is the opposite structure?"
- Useful for exclusion lists and constraint mapping

## When NOT to Use

Avoid rhyme for:
- Rigorous proof or validation (use formal methods)
- When you need precision over intuition
- Highly technical domains where analogies mislead
- When existing formal models are adequate
- Time-critical decisions (too exploratory)
