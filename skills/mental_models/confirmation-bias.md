# Confirmation Bias

Tendency to seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.

## How It Manifests

- **Seeking:** searching for evidence that supports your hypothesis while not searching for disconfirming evidence
- **Interpreting:** reading ambiguous data as supporting your position
- **Remembering:** recalling confirming examples more easily than disconfirming ones
- **Testing:** designing experiments that can only confirm, never falsify

## Counters

- Ask "what would change my mind?" before analyzing
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence with the same effort you'd use to confirm
- Assign someone to argue the opposite position (devil's advocate)
- Pre-register your predictions before seeing results
- Consider the base rate before evaluating specific evidence
