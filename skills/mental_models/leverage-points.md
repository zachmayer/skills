# Leverage Points

Places in a system where a small change can produce large effects. Donella Meadows' hierarchy from least to most effective:

## The Hierarchy (ascending effectiveness)

12. **Constants, parameters, numbers** — adjusting knobs (tax rates, speed limits). Easy to change, rarely transformative.
11. **Buffer sizes** — stabilizing stocks relative to flows (inventory levels, cash reserves).
10. **Material stocks and flows** — physical infrastructure (roads, pipelines, factories).
9. **Delays** — lengths of time relative to system change rates. Delays cause oscillation.
8. **Balancing feedback loops** — strength of corrective mechanisms (audits, reviews, regulations).
7. **Reinforcing feedback loops** — strength of growth/collapse drivers (viral loops, compound interest).
6. **Information flows** — who has access to what information, when (transparency, dashboards, whistleblowing).
5. **Rules** — incentives, punishments, constraints (laws, policies, game rules).
4. **Self-organization** — the ability of the system to change its own structure (evolution, learning, adaptation).
3. **Goals** — the purpose of the system (what the system optimizes for).
2. **Paradigms** — the mindset or worldview the system operates under.
1. **Transcending paradigms** — the ability to change paradigms.

## Process

1. **Map the system** — identify stocks, flows, feedback loops, delays
2. **Find current leverage point** — where are you intervening now?
3. **Move up the hierarchy** — can you intervene at a higher leverage point?
4. **Beware counterintuitive effects** — higher leverage points are harder to predict; they may push the system in unexpected directions

## Key Insight

Most people intervene at parameters (level 12) because it's easy. The real leverage is in rules, goals, information flows, and feedback loop structure — but these require deeper systemic understanding.
