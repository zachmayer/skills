# Python Boilerplate Template

## What Is This?

These are my own preferences for setting up a python package and/or repo.
It collects tools and dev dependencies for all the things I like when
I start a new python project.

- pytest
- pre-commit: If you don't use it, you should start.
- ruff: For all your linting and formatting needs.
- uv: A fast package/environment manager
- ipython: Run with `uv run ipython`. Nicer than regular interpreter
- github actions: There are basic github action for CI
- Makefile: a convenient way to run scripts

You can use this repo as a template.
see: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template

## Dev Install

This requires [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
They have installation instructions.

### Linux/Mac

`make install`

### Windows

You will first need to install `make`.

`make` is standard on linux devices but needs to be installed on Windows.
see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32127632 for a long discussion or ...

1. install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
2. run `choco install make`

then `make install`

## Running Stuff

### With `make`

You can run most commands you want from the `Makefile`

- `make install`
- `make lint`
- `make test`
- `make build` to build the package
- `make upgrade` to upgrade all of the libraries and pre-commit

### With `uv run`

Any commands that would run in your envronment, you can do with a `uv run`
prefix.  So `pytest`, `ipython`, `pre-commit` just add `uv run <command> <args>`
like `uv run pytest -s -v --durations=10`

If you have built the package, you should be able to `uv run demo-script`

### Pre-Commit

Sometimes you'll have a commit that won't pass but you'll fix it later.
Bypass checks on your commit with the `-n` flag. So instead of
`git commit -am 'my message'`, do `git commit -am 'my message' -n`.


## Repo Setup

### Github Actions

github actions must always be located in `.github/workflows`

This repo contains two actions

- Lint And Test: Run linter and pytest on PRs and merge to main.
  Located in: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`
- Update Dependencies: Run a weekly update job and open PR on changes.
  Located in: `.github/workflows/updater.yaml`

#### Using the Update Dependencies Action

**If you use this action remove `eric-s-s` as an assignee in `updater.yaml`!**

This runs updates to all libraries on a weekly basis. If there are file
changes, it automatically creates a PR and assigns me (eric-s-s) to the PR.
If you want something like this you'll need to do some updating. Including
from the next section with personal access token management.

#### Personal Access Token Management for PR actions

**Use the new fine-grained access tokens!** You have no good reason
not to, and they are more secure.

The `create-pull-request` github action explains the following for
tokens and their requirements. I've also included the example I used.

- https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request?tab=readme-ov-file#token
- https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/examples.md#update-npm-dependencies

And GitHub explains about personal access tokens and repo secrets here:

- https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token
- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository

### Repo Settings

#### General Repo Settings - Pull Request Section

`Pull Request` section let's you specify what kind of PR merging to allow
I tend to only do  `Allow squash merging` with `Default commit message`
set to `Pull request title and commit details`.

It also contains the `Automatically delete head branches`

#### Branch Rulesets

rulesets are available in the repo-rulesets directory. You can import them in your repo
in `settings > general > code and automation > rules > rulesets`

the green `New ruleset` button on the right has a drop-down arrow that allows you to
import. It should just work, but if it doesn't ..

#### Branch Ruleset Required Status Checks

The required status checks part is a bit annoying. You need to pick
from an auto-generated list and you might need to run the action first

For the github action below I've seen it auto-complete on either

- basic-ci
- run linting and testing

```
jobs:
  basic-ci:
    name: run linting and testing
```

## Random Helpful Notes

### Pycharm Settings

For some reason, Pycharm uses an incorrect json schema for `.github/dependabot.yml`. You can set
this manually by going to:

`Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> Schemas and DTDs -> JSON Schema Mappings` and adding
a mapping for https://www.schemastore.org/dependabot-2.0.json with JSON version 7 pointing to
your dependabot file.
