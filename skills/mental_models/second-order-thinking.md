# Second-Order Thinking

Ask "and then what?" at least three times. First-order effects are obvious; second and third-order effects are where plans fail and strategies succeed.

## Process

1. **Identify the action/decision** under consideration
2. **First-order effects** — what happens immediately? (obvious, everyone sees these)
3. **Second-order effects** — "and then what?" What do the first-order effects cause?
4. **Third-order effects** — "and then what?" What do the second-order effects cause?
5. **Check for sign flips** — does a positive first-order effect become negative at second or third order?
6. **Check for feedback loops** — do any effects reinforce or dampen themselves?

## Common Sign Flips

- Speed improvement → developers skip tests → bug rate increases → net slower
- Cost cutting → quality drops → customers leave → revenue drops more than cost saved
- Adding process → feels safer → slows delivery → team works around process → less safe
- Hiring fast → culture dilution → coordination overhead → slower than before hiring

## Key Principle

First-order thinkers look for simple, direct solutions. Second-order thinkers ask "and then what?" The ability to think through second and third-order effects is what separates good decisions from obvious ones. Most unintended consequences are second-order effects nobody considered.
