# Occam's Razor

The simplest explanation that fits ALL the facts is usually correct. Don't add complexity until simple explanations fail.

## Application

- **Debugging:** the boring explanation is almost always right. Check typos before refactoring.
- **Architecture:** choose the simplest design that meets requirements. Add complexity only when forced by evidence.
- **Root cause analysis:** prefer explanations requiring fewer assumptions. "The deploy broke it" beats "cosmic ray bit flip."
- **Communication:** if you can't explain it simply, you may not understand it well enough.

## Common Misuse

Occam's Razor does NOT say "the simplest explanation is always right." It says: among explanations that equally fit the facts, prefer the simpler one. If the simple explanation doesn't fit the facts, it's wrong regardless of its simplicity.
