# Pattern Language

Solutions to recurring problems exist as interconnected patterns. Each pattern has: context, problem, forces in tension, solution, consequences.

## Structure of a Pattern

1. **Context** — when does this situation arise?
2. **Problem** — what tension or conflict exists?
3. **Forces** — what competing concerns make this hard?
4. **Solution** — what resolves the tension?
5. **Consequences** — what new situations does the solution create?

## Application

- **Architecture:** design patterns (Observer, Strategy, Factory) are a pattern language for software structure
- **Process:** agile ceremonies (standup, retro, planning) are a pattern language for team coordination
- **Communication:** writing patterns (introduction, argument, evidence, conclusion) form a language
- **Good architecture is a network of patterns** that reinforce each other. Isolated patterns are less effective than interconnected ones.

## Key Insight

Naming patterns makes them composable and communicable. Once you name it, you can discuss it, teach it, and combine it with other patterns. The language is the patterns AND their relationships.
