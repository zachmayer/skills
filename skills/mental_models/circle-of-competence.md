# Circle of Competence

Know the boundary between what you actually understand and what you think you understand. The skill is knowing where the edge is.

## Three Zones

- **Inside the circle:** genuine, deep understanding. You know the patterns, failure modes, and edge cases. Make decisions confidently here.
- **Edge of the circle:** partial knowledge. You know enough to know what you don't know. Proceed carefully, seek expert input.
- **Outside the circle:** you don't know what you don't know. This is where Dunning-Kruger lives. Defer to experts or invest in learning before deciding.

## Application

- **Decision-making:** inside your circle, trust your judgment. Outside, get help.
- **Estimation:** you can estimate accurately inside your circle. Outside, use base rates and reference classes.
- **Growth:** deliberately expand your circle by studying adjacent domains, but acknowledge you're learning, not expert.

## Key Insight

The size of your circle matters less than knowing its boundary. A small, well-mapped circle is more valuable than a large, poorly-bounded one.
