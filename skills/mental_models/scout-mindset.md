# Scout Mindset

Your goal is to see what's actually there, not to build a case for what you want to see.

## Scout vs. Soldier Mindset

- **Soldier mindset:** reasoning is about defending a position. Evidence is ammunition. Being wrong is defeat.
- **Scout mindset:** reasoning is about mapping reality accurately. Evidence is data. Being wrong is an update.

## Practices

- Ask "what would change my mind?" BEFORE analyzing
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Treat being wrong as an update, not a failure
- Notice when you feel defensive about a conclusion — that's a signal to examine it more carefully
- The measure of good reasoning is calibration (how often your 80% predictions come true 80% of the time), not confidence

## Application

- **Code review:** look for what's wrong, not for reasons to approve
- **Architecture decisions:** genuinely evaluate alternatives instead of building a case for your preference
- **Debugging:** follow the evidence to the bug, not to the explanation you prefer
- **Estimation:** calibrate by tracking your predictions against outcomes
