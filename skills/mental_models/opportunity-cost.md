# Opportunity Cost

The hidden cost of any choice is the best alternative foregone. Every yes is a no to something else.

## Process

1. **Identify the choice** and what you're selecting
2. **List alternatives** — what else could you do with the same time/money/resources?
3. **Identify the best alternative** — this is your opportunity cost
4. **Compare** — is your choice better than the best alternative?

## Application Patterns

- **Time allocation:** every hour on task A is an hour not spent on task B. "Is this the highest-value use of my next hour?"
- **Feature decisions:** every feature built is a feature not built. Prioritize ruthlessly.
- **Technical debt:** the cost of not refactoring isn't the debt itself — it's the features you can't build because of it
- **Meetings:** the opportunity cost of a 1-hour meeting with 8 people is 8 person-hours of productive work

## Key Insight

The cost of something is not its price — it's what you give up to get it. Explicitly naming the opportunity cost makes hidden tradeoffs visible and prevents the trap of evaluating choices in isolation.
