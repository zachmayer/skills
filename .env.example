# API keys for skills that call external AI providers (discussion_partners, etc.)
#
# Add these to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
#   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
#   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
#
# Then reload: source ~/.zshrc
# Claude Code sources your shell profile at startup — no extra config needed.
