# Handlize

Strip rhetoric, test novelty, return only **handles** — concepts with operational grip. Answers: "what here could actually change what I do?" Not summary, not critique — residue extraction.

## What Counts as a Handle

A handle is a concept, frame, or distinction that:
- **Constrains or enables action** — changes what decisions or designs are viable
- **Is operationalizable** — can be measured, modeled, or intervened on
- **Is non-rhetorical** — not merely a justification or applause light

Classify each handle by context as:
- **Live** — executable, underused, low decay
- **Burned** — real referent but term degraded (e.g., "alignment" in corporate strategy); keep only if operationalized
- **Dead** — no operational content; drop

## Dials

| Dial | Range | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Extraction strictness** | permissive → strict | How aggressively to discard non-executable material |
| **Novelty threshold** | contextual → primitive | How new a concept must be to count |
| **Operational demand** | sketch → concrete | How fully the handle must be cashed out |
| **Burned handle policy** | ignore / drop / rehabilitate | How to treat degraded terms (rehabilitate → raises operational bar) |

Always state assumed domain/audience/problem — handle status is context-relative.

## Process

1. **Set context + dials** — state domain, audience, problem; set dial positions
2. **Remove rhetorical mass** — drop throat-clearing, prestige adjectives, moral signaling, audience-calibration fluff
3. **Harvest candidates** — pull any concept, frame, or distinction implying different decisions, models, or interventions
4. **Evaluate each candidate:**
   - Actionability: would this change a decision boundary?
   - Operationalizability: can it be expressed in variables, mechanisms, metrics?
   - Novelty: is it new to this context vs renamed common sense?
5. **Classify status (context-relative):**
   - Live: executable, underused, low decay
   - Burned: real referent but degraded; keep only if operationalized (raise bar when policy = rehabilitate)
   - Dead: no operational content; drop
6. **Gestalt check** — if breaking into parts removes causal grip, keep as one handle and mark **gestalt-dependent**
7. **Emit residue** — output surviving handles; allow null result if nothing survives

## Output Schema (required)

For each surviving handle:
- **handle:** concise formulation
- **status:** live | burned | dead
- **context:** assumed domain/audience
- **why it matters:** what action, model, or decision it enables
- **operationalization sketch:** variables, mechanism, possible measurement
- **gestalt-dependent:** yes | no

If no handles survive: state **"no executable residue found"** and briefly why.

## Quality Criteria

- States context and dial settings up front
- Discards rhetoric without erasing candidate meaning
- Distinguishes live vs burned vs dead with justification
- Raises operational bar when rehabilitating burned terms
- Flags gestalt dependence instead of fragmenting
- Allows null output; no forced handles
