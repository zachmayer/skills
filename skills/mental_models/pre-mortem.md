# Pre-Mortem

Before starting, imagine the project has already failed. What went wrong? Fix those things now.

## Process

1. **Assume failure** — "It's 6 months from now. The project failed completely. What happened?"
2. **Generate failure modes** — each participant independently lists reasons for failure (removes groupthink)
3. **Collect and cluster** — group similar failure modes
4. **Prioritize** — rank by likelihood × impact
5. **Mitigate** — for top 3-5 failure modes, define specific preventive actions
6. **Assign ownership** — each mitigation gets an owner and a check-in date

## Why Pre-Mortems Beat Post-Mortems

- **Prospective hindsight** is more accurate than prospective foresight — imagining a future event already happened makes people better at generating explanations
- **Permission to dissent** — framing as "imagine it failed" gives cover to voice concerns that feel disloyal when framed as "this might fail"
- **Actionable timing** — you can still change course

## When to Use

- Before committing to a major project or architecture
- Before a launch or migration
- When a plan feels "too smooth" — pre-mortem surfaces what's being glossed over
- After a planning session, as the closing exercise
