# Sunk Cost Fallacy

Continuing an endeavor because of past investment rather than future value. The money/time/effort is already spent regardless of what you do next.

## The Test

"Knowing what I know now, would I start this from scratch?" If no, the sunk cost is anchoring you.

## Common Manifestations

- Continuing a failing project because "we've already invested so much"
- Watching a bad movie to the end because you paid for the ticket
- Staying in a bad job because of years invested
- Maintaining legacy code because of the effort it took to write

## Counter

Evaluate decisions based only on future costs and benefits. Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions. The question is never "how much have we spent?" but "is the best use of our NEXT dollar/hour continuing this or starting something else?"
