# Tragedy of the Commons

Individual rational behavior depleting a shared resource. Each actor takes more because the benefit is private and the cost is distributed.

## The Pattern

- Shared resource with open access
- Individual benefit of using/taking exceeds individual cost
- Cumulative usage exceeds sustainable capacity
- Resource degrades or collapses

## Examples

- **Technical:** shared CI pipeline, shared database, shared on-call bandwidth, shared context window
- **Organizational:** shared meeting time, shared team bandwidth, shared code ownership (everyone's responsibility = nobody's responsibility)
- **System:** rate limits, API quotas, disk space, memory

## Solutions

- **Privatize:** give ownership to a specific entity responsible for sustainability
- **Regulate:** impose usage limits, quotas, or costs
- **Monitor:** make usage visible so social pressure works
- **Align incentives:** make the cost of overuse visible to the individual user
