# Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

Roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Find the vital few before optimizing the trivial many.

## Application

- **Bugs:** 80% of crashes come from 20% of code paths. Profile before optimizing.
- **Features:** 80% of user value comes from 20% of features. Build those first.
- **Effort:** 80% of results come from 20% of your time. Identify your highest-leverage activities.
- **Customers:** 80% of revenue often comes from 20% of customers. Know who they are.

## Process

1. **Measure** — don't guess which 20% matters. Look at data.
2. **Rank** — sort by impact. The distribution is usually steeper than you expect.
3. **Focus** — invest disproportionately in the vital few.
4. **Iterate** — after addressing the top 20%, the next 20% becomes the new focus.

## Key Insight

The ratio isn't always exactly 80/20, but the distribution is almost always skewed. A small number of inputs produce a disproportionate share of outputs. Finding that small number is the highest-leverage analytical move.
