# Hanlon's Razor

Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by ignorance, incompetence, or misaligned incentives.

## Application

- **Bug reports:** the developer probably didn't know about the edge case, not that they were lazy
- **Process failures:** the system allowed the error, not that someone deliberately caused it
- **Communication:** they probably didn't understand the requirement, not that they ignored it
- **Organizations:** most dysfunction comes from misaligned incentives and poor information flow, not malicious actors

## Key Insight

Assuming malice escalates conflict and closes off cooperative solutions. Assuming ignorance or misalignment opens the door to education, better incentives, and systemic fixes. The systems explanation is almost always more accurate and more actionable than the character explanation.
